There are several areas where the assessment of coherence is regularly conducted: between provisional and final statistics, between annual and short-term statistics, between statistics from the same socio-economic domain, and between survey statistics and national accounts. The concept of coherence is closely related to the concept of comparability between statistical domains. Both coherence and comparability refer to a data set with respect to another. The difference between the two is that comparability refers to comparisons between statistics based on usually unrelated statistical populations and coherence refers to comparisons between statistics for the same or largely similar populations. In the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) of the International Monetary Fund, the term "consistency" is used for indicating "logical and numerical coherence".

    rdfs:comment """1) Potential application across all statistical domains. Examples: CL_OBS_STATUS, CL_CONF_STATUS, CL_DECIMALS, CL_UNIT_MULT, CL_AREA. Explanatory note: Key term for this criterion is "potential". These code lists must not necessarily be implemented in all Data Structure Definitions (DSDs) but they potentially could. For example, code list "Unit multiplier" could possibly be used in all implementations dealing with statistical figures but some implementations might not see the need for such a dimension because the statistical values do not require it, e.g. average number of children per household. Inversely, in this example a code list for decimals will be absolutely necessary. 2) Code lists maintained by the SWG on its initiative because 1) they are intended for broad use within the SDMX community and 2) there is a strong need for harmonisation across domains which are not necessarily closely connected with each other. Examples for case 1: CL_AGE, CL_CIVIL_STATUS, CL_FREQ, CL_TIME_FORMAT, CL_SEX, CL_ADJUSTMENT. Explanatory note: By proposing such code lists it is hoped to promote harmonisation across domains and provide ready-to-use artefacts to implementers. Example for case 2: CL_ACTIVITY. Explanatory note: International activity classifications are typically used in different statistical domains (e.g. economic versus social statistics). Without an established CDCL made available in centralised registries, the risk is that one domain develops a code list without taking into account the fact that other domains might use the same classification system. 3) Code lists recommended as CDCL by the SDMX Statistical Working Group (SWG) although they are in principle maintained by third organisations. Examples: CL_AREA (based on the ISO 3166 alpha-2 codes for countries); CL_CURRENCY (based on the ISO 4217 3-character codes for currencies). Explanatory note: In these cases, the value added by the SWG is to propose guidelines on specific methodological issues, e.g. how to code a country that has been split into several new entities."""@en .

    rdfs:comment """A DSD defines the structure of an organised collection of data (Data Set) by means of concepts with specific roles, and their representation. In order to exchange or disseminate statistical information, an institution needs to specify which statistical concepts are necessary for identifying the series (and for use as dimensions) and which statistical concepts are to be used as attributes and measures. These definitions form the data structure definition. In a data collection scenario the specification of the data structure definition is often a collaborative venture between the collecting institution and its partners. There are three types of construct in the DSD: Dimension, Attribute, and Measure. Each of these combines a Concept with its representation (this can be either a reference to a Code list or a non-coded data type such as "integer", "string", "date/time"). The roles of the three types of construct (Dimension, Attribute, and Measure) are as follows: A Dimension is an identifying component, sometimes referred to as a "classificatory variable". When a value is given to each of the Dimensions in a data set (this is often called a "key" or a "series") the resulting key, when combined with a time value, uniquely identifies an observation. For instance, country, indicator, measurement unit, frequency, and time dimensions together identify the cells in a cross-country time series with multiple indicators (for example, gross domestic product, gross domestic debt) measured in different units (for example, various currencies, percent changes) and at different frequencies (for example, annual, quarterly). The cells in such a multi-dimensional table contain the observation values. The DSD construct that specifies the Concept and expected representation of an observation is called a Measure. The semantics of the measure are derived from the Dimensions or a sub set of them and, if not specified in a Dimension, an Attribute indicating the measurement unit e.g. indicator and measure unit (gross domestic product percentage change). Additional metadata that are useful for understanding or processing the observed value or the context of data set or series are called an Attribute in the DSD. Examples of an attribute are a note on the observation, a confidentiality status, or the unit of measure used, or the Title of a series."""@en .

Assessing relevance is subjective and depends upon the varying needs of users. The Agency's challenge is to weight and balance the conflicting needs of current and potential users to produce statistics that satisfy the most important needs within given resource constraints. In assessing relevance, one approach is to gauge relevance directly, by polling users about the data. Indirect evidence of relevance may be found by ascertaining where there are processes in place to determine the uses of data and the views of their users or to use the data in-house for research and other analysis. Relevance refers to the processes for monitoring the relevance and practical usefulness of existing statistics in meeting users' needs and how these processes impact the development of statistical programmes."@en .

VALUATION ;

    skos:definition "Definition of the price per unit, for goods and services flows and asset stocks."@en ;
    rdfs:comment "Standard national accounts valuations include the basic price (what the seller receives) and the purchaser's price (what the purchaser pays). The purchaser's price is the basic price, plus taxes less subsidies on products, plus invoiced transportation and insurance services, plus distribution margin. Other valuation bases may be used in other contexts. International trade in goods considers the free on board (fob) price and cost-insurance-freight price, among others. The concept refers to valuation rules used for recording flows and stocks, including how consistent the practices used are with internationally accepted standards, guidelines, or good practices."@en .
